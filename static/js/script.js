                question: "I'm new to pet grooming, what should I expect?",
                answer: "First of all, a big thank you for coming to visit. Every pet that comes in to be groomed is treated like our own pet, so they're in good hands with us. On your first visit, we'll get you and your pet registered on our system and ask a few questions to better understand what type of groom you'd like. We'll also use our expertise to help guide you on any breed-specific considerations. This will be documented on our 'grooming contract.' We can also give you a tour of our salon and take you behind the scenes to reassure you that your pet's care is our top priority."

                question: "Why do you charge a deposit for my pet's groom?",
